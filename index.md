Choosing classes in college is one of the most critical decisions in every studentâ€™s academic life, and every student encounters this predicament every semester. We propose PickMyClasses, a web-based application that assists college students in the process of choosing classes. Our project is novel and valuable in three ways, by:

Connecting and streamlining the class-picking process by integrating searching, scheduling, and feedback-collecting tools into one package.
Applying data-driven, interactive visualizations to increase the comprehension, communication, and decision-making of picking classes.
Providing customizable course feedback to the professors to produce a vibrant academic community and advance the overall educational outcome.
